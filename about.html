      <h2 class="big-heading">Greetings!</h2>

      <p>
        I am an Architectural designer, in the process of transitioning to a career in UX research and design. I am focused 
        on creating meaningful experiences through design, enhancing human product interaction through creative problem solving 
        and am passionate about learning new things every day.<br><br><br><br>
        
        What made me shift from Architecture to UX design? <br><br>
        Throughout my 5 years of architectural education, the thing I enjoyed the most was the initial research and
        design conceptualization stage of a project. I loved doing user research, and discovering user needs and wants. I even 
        took up an elective on Neuroscience and Architecture, to delve deeper into how humans perceive spaces and how design affects 
        human behaviours. This made me realise that, along with having a strong interest in design, I was also incredibly interested 
        in people – how they think, how they feel, why they do the things they do. <br><br>
        
        I always believed that design should not only be visual but should solve real-world problems and enhance human experiences. 
        But, during my experience as an intern architect, I started realising that many times architectural projects tend to focus more 
        on client needs and the visual appeal than user needs and behaviours. I also started understanding that a design that you spend 
        years working on, ends up impacting the lives of very few people. Around this same time, I started researching more about product 
        design and ended up discovering UX design. <br><br>
        
        The idea that user experience design is a perfect blend of design, technology, human behaviour, and psychology, is something that 
        intrigued me a lot. The more I read about it, the more I started loving it and realising that this might be something for me. 
        After my graduation, I took up some courses, read UX case studies, blogs, and tried to get my hands on it to understand it better 
        and to make sure that it is something that I actually enjoy doing. I loved the fact that UX design projects are faster paced and 
        unlike architectural design, here you get to improve a design even after it’s built- by receiving continuous user feedback, and reiterating 
        designs to ultimately satisfy the end-users. I also find it extremely rewarding that you get to impact the lives of a large 
        number of people through UX design. <br><br>
        
        User research, designing user-centric spaces while keeping in mind client goals, carrying out multiple design iterations, 
        creating visually appealing graphics, and making design presentations has been a crucial part of my 5 years of architectural education 
        and practice. I strongly believe I can use these skills and experience acquired in the past few years, to successfully transcend 
        in the field of UX design.
